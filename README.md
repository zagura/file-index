# File Indexer

Project to index files into sql database.

It was created for easier managing large set of files with slow access.  
My usecase was find and manage duplicate files in usb external HDD drive. fdupes was ineffective as fileset was over 1TB.

Project is unfinished and was used once, in June 2018.

## Requirements

 * python3
 * sqlalchemy
